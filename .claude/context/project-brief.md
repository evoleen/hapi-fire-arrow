# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: HAPI Fire Arrow  
**Repository**: https://github.com/evoleen/hapi-fire-arrow  
**Base Project**: HAPI FHIR JPA Server Starter  
**Current Version**: 8.4.0-2  

## What It Is

HAPI Fire Arrow is a production-ready FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) server implementation built on the HAPI FHIR framework. It provides a complete, standards-compliant healthcare data interoperability platform that enables healthcare organizations to store, manage, and exchange clinical data using FHIR standards.

## Why It Exists

### Primary Purpose
Healthcare systems worldwide struggle with data interoperability - the ability to exchange and use clinical data across different systems, organizations, and platforms. HAPI Fire Arrow solves this by providing:

1. **Standards Compliance**: Full implementation of FHIR R4/R5 specifications
2. **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade server with scalability and security features
3. **Open Source Foundation**: Cost-effective alternative to proprietary solutions
4. **Comprehensive Features**: Beyond basic FHIR, includes clinical reasoning, quality measures, and advanced data management

### Business Problem Solved
- **Data Silos**: Breaking down barriers between healthcare systems
- **Interoperability Costs**: Reducing integration complexity and costs
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Enabling evidence-based care at the point of service
- **Quality Reporting**: Automating clinical quality measure calculation
- **Patient Safety**: Improving care coordination through better data access

## Project Scope

### In Scope

#### Core FHIR Server Functionality
- Complete FHIR REST API implementation (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search)
- Support for FHIR versions: DSTU2, DSTU3, R4, R4B, R5
- Resource validation and terminology services
- Subscription system for real-time notifications
- Bulk data operations and export capabilities

#### Advanced Healthcare Features
- **Clinical Reasoning (CQL)**: Clinical Quality Language execution
- **CDS Hooks**: Clinical Decision Support integration
- **Master Data Management**: Patient identity resolution and linking  
- **Quality Measures**: Automated clinical quality reporting
- **Implementation Guides**: Runtime loading and validation

#### Enterprise Capabilities
- Scalable multi-instance deployment
- Database support (H2, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Container and Kubernetes deployment
- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
- Security framework and audit logging

### Out of Scope
- **Authentication/Authorization Implementation**: Framework provided, specific implementation not included
- **Enterprise Audit Logging**: Basic audit provided, enterprise-grade logging requires additional configuration
- **Multi-instance Shared Caching**: Default implementations are in-memory only
- **Frontend Applications**: Server-side only, UI applications built separately
- **Custom Clinical Workflows**: Generic FHIR server, workflow-specific logic implemented by users

## Key Objectives

### Short-term Goals (Current Development)
1. **Server Branding**: Complete customization and branding features
2. **Claude Integration**: Finalize AI-assisted development workflow
3. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation
4. **Documentation**: Complete setup and deployment guides

### Medium-term Goals (3-6 months)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced throughput and response times
2. **Security Hardening**: Production-grade security implementations
3. **Advanced Features**: Extended clinical reasoning capabilities
4. **Integration Examples**: Reference implementations for common use cases

### Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
1. **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Optimized for cloud platforms
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Modular deployment options
3. **Extended Interoperability**: Additional healthcare standards support
4. **Community Ecosystem**: Plugin architecture and developer tools
