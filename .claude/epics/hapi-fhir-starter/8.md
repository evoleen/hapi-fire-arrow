# Server Foundation and Branding

## Overview
Establish the foundational server infrastructure and implement custom branding for the HAPI FHIR starter application.

## Description
This task involves setting up the core server configuration, implementing custom branding elements, and ensuring the server foundation is properly configured for the HAPI FHIR starter application. This includes server initialization, basic configuration management, and visual branding elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server starts successfully with custom configuration (use existing application.yaml configuration)
- [ ] Custom branding is applied to the web interface
- [ ] The "global tester" option is removed
- [ ] The "local tester" option is now the default
- [ ] The "local tester" doesn't appear in the UI anymore
- [ ] The application.yaml configuration doesn't list our overlay code as "tester" anymore but as fire_arrow_server
- [ ] Server health endpoints are functional
- [ ] Basic logging and monitoring are configured
- [ ] Server configuration is externalized and environment-specific
- [ ] Custom favicon and logos are integrated
- [ ] Application title and descriptions reflect custom branding

## Technical Details
- Configure server startup and initialization
- Implement custom CSS/styling for branding
- Set up configuration management system
- Establish logging framework
- Configure health check endpoints
- Integrate custom assets (logos, favicons)
- Update application metadata and titles

## Files to Modify
- Server configuration files
- Web interface templates
- CSS/styling files
- Asset directories
- Application properties

## Testing Requirements
- Server startup verification
- Health endpoint testing
- Visual branding validation
- Configuration loading tests
- Cross-browser compatibility checks

## Notes
This is a foundational task that establishes the base infrastructure. Other tasks may depend on the server foundation being properly established.
