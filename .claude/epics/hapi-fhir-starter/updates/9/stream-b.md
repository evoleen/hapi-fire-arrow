# Stream B: Spring Security Configuration

## Scope
Spring Security setup, filter chains, and authentication flow

## Files
- `src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/starter/security/SecurityConfig.java`
- `src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/starter/security/OAuth2ResourceServerConfig.java`
- `src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/starter/security/AuthenticationEntryPoint.java`

## Progress
- ✅ Created security package structure
- ✅ Added Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server dependencies to pom.xml
- ✅ Implemented SecurityConfig.java with comprehensive OAuth2 Resource Server configuration
- ✅ Implemented OAuth2ResourceServerConfig.java with multi-provider JWT decoder support
- ✅ Implemented CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint.java with FHIR-compliant error responses
- ✅ Created AuthenticationEntryPoint.java interface for extensibility
- ✅ Configured security filter chains for FHIR endpoints (/fhir/**)
- ✅ Configured management endpoint security (/actuator/**)
- ✅ Implemented CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Added proper security headers including HSTS
- ✅ Compilation successful - all files compile without errors

## Key Features Implemented

### SecurityConfig.java
- Multiple security filter chains with proper ordering
- OAuth2 Resource Server configuration with JWT validation
- CORS support for web clients
- Security headers (HSTS, frame options, content type options)
- Conditional activation based on `hapi.fhir.auth.enabled` property

### OAuth2ResourceServerConfig.java
- Multi-provider JWT decoder support (Azure AD and standard OIDC)
- JWT authentication converter with claim mapping
- Role extraction from JWT claims (including FHIR resource types)
- Fallback decoder for multiple OAuth providers

### CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint.java
- FHIR-compliant OperationOutcome error responses
- Proper WWW-Authenticate headers for OAuth2 errors
- Security-focused error message sanitization
- Detailed error categorization based on JWT validation failures

## Integration Points
- Integrates with existing AuthConfigurationProperties
- Compatible with HAPI FHIR security framework
- Supports multiple OAuth providers as specified in requirements
- Ready for Azure Identity and standard OAuth/OIDC providers

## Status: COMPLETED
All Spring Security configuration files have been implemented and compile successfully.
