# OAuth JWT Integration

## Overview
Implement OAuth 2.0 with JWT token support for secure authentication and authorization in the HAPI FHIR starter application.

## Description
This task involves integrating OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with JWT (JSON Web Token) support to provide secure access control for the FHIR server. This includes token validation, user authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 authorization server integration is functional
- [ ] JWT token validation is implemented
- [ ] Token-based authentication works for API endpoints
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism is operational
- [ ] Configurable claim fields in application.yaml allow extraction of a FHIR user role resource type as well as a FHIR ID. FHIR ID must be optional.
- [ ] Allow multiple auth system configurations in application.yaml
- [ ] Support Azure Identity as special form of OAuth by supplying a tenant ID and application ID
- [ ] Support "normal" OAuth through OIDC discovery URL and audience
- [ ] Token expiration and renewal handled properly
- [ ] Secure token storage and transmission implemented
- [ ] Integration with external OAuth providers supported

## Technical Details
- Configure OAuth 2.0 client credentials
- Implement JWT token parsing and validation
- Set up authentication interceptors
- Configure authorization scopes and permissions
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Add security headers and CORS configuration
- Integrate with HAPI FHIR security framework
- Support multiple OAuth providers (configurable) through auto-discovery URL and acceptable audience.

## Files to Modify
- Security configuration classes
- Authentication interceptors
- OAuth client configuration
- JWT token validation logic
- Authorization permission mappings
- Security filter chains

## Testing Requirements
- OAuth flow end-to-end testing
- JWT token validation tests
- Authorization permission verification
- Token expiration and refresh testing
- Security vulnerability assessments
- Integration tests with external OAuth providers

## Notes
This authentication system will be used by the Identity Resolution Service and other components requiring secure access. Proper implementation is critical for overall system security.
